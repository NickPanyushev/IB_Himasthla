# IB_Himasthla
This project is about TE search in Himasthla transcriptome

## Introduction
Repeated DNA makes up a large fraction of a typical mammalian genome, and some repetitive elements are able to move within the genome (transposons and retrotransposons). DNA transposons move from one genomic location to another by a cut-and-paste mechanism. They are powerful forces of genetic change and have played a significant role in the evolution of many genomes.
Transposons can cause genome variability in trematodes. Therefore, the study of transcription of transposons - the initial stage in the study of these processes

## Objective:
Finding transposons in Himasthla elongate genome using different tools and comparative analysis of their results

## Goals:

1. Filtering reads using BBTools, Trimmomatic;

2. Transcriptome assembly using rnaSPAdes or Trinity;

3. Identification of transposable elements using different tools(RepeatModeller, RepeatMasker, Repeatexplorer2)
